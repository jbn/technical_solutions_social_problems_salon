# 1. Salon Title

Technical Solutions to Social Problems

# 2. Description

## Intro sentence

**For his first InterIntellect Salon, @generativist asks us to flip the claim "there are no technical solutions to social problems," and instead explore the possibilities of emerging ones.**

I don't mean to reject the assertion in a flippant way. Social problems tend to be wicked ones! "You can't fix people with software" is a reasonable assumption and default. A healthy respect for the problem is...well, healthy.

But computers mediate our lives and social spaces more and more. These are complex technical artifacts THAT PEOPLE BUILD. If they induce observable problems, it's absurd to claim there can't possibly be technical solutions.
